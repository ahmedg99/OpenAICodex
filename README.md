# OpenAI Codex Code Generation Project

## Project Description

The objective of this project is to leverage the power of OpenAI Codex to generate clean and bug-free code. Additionally, the project aims to create a comparative analysis to highlight the levels of improvement in development operations.

## Project Goals

- Utilize OpenAI Codex to automatically generate code snippets and scripts.
- Ensure the generated code is syntactically correct, well-structured, and free of common bugs.
- Compare the generated code with manually-written code to evaluate the level of improvement in development operations.
- Provide insights and analysis on the benefits and limitations of using OpenAI Codex for code generation.

## Technologies Used

- OpenAI Codex: The project relies on OpenAI Codex, a powerful language model trained specifically for code generation.
- Git: Version control system to manage and track project changes.
